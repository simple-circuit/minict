Read Me Raspberry Pi

This is an experimental port of MiniCT to the Raspberry Pi running Debian Linux.
Some features of the curve tracer such as sound were disabled.
File locating is not as robust as in other versions and the calibration file may need to be moved to the start up or other directories.
The curve tracer USB adapter will not work except when plugged into one of the two native Raspberry Pi USB ports (version B board).
Drooping of the 5V supply may cause clipping of the output waveform or reduced common mode current sensing range.
