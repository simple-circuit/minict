Mini_CT Revisions
3-31-12
Fixed color palet problem with trace color after loading 256 color bmp image in script file.
Tried to fix failure to recognize USB interface. Stopped timer until CT S/N returned.
Fixed error in script plotting that did not register new trace after hashing a pointer.
4-3-12
Added bmp images for calibration
Moved calibration routine text to pop up form
4-11-12
Added file search for html help when root directory changes
4-12-12
Added calibration capability for 1meg resistor in 5th switch setting.
Increased collector current measurement cal from 9 places to 12 for more accuracy using 1meg resistor.
Thinking of adding subract mode to allow capacitance loop zeroing.
Could be part of compare trace function.
4-14-12
Improved capacitor constant kcap for more accurate measurements
Added zero function button to allow lead resistance and capacitance subtraction
4-28-12
Added wave type to set up script
7-24-13
Added 1M resistor to calibration menu.
Added documented script command plotcvic to allow slow plotting of nodes with large capacitance.
7-25-13
Added undocumented script command plotbvcv to allow voltage I/O sweep for logic device threshold test
Added undocumented script command setp3 for setting port P3 pins. P3.4-P3.0 are available on mini_CT card
